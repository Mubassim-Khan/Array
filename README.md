# Array
This Repository contains programs of Array in Java & Python. It contains concepts of 1D Arrays, 2D Arrays & other concepts related to these major topics in Data Structures & Programming. Following are the programs available in this repository:

### 1D-Array Programs
- Store elements in an array and print it.
- Read "n" number of values in an array and display it in reverse order.
- Sum of all elements of the array
- Find the maximum and minimum element in an array
- Separate odd and even integers in separate arrays.
- Input a list of characters in an array and count the number of vowels in the array.
- A 1D array, filled with randomly generated numbers.
- Read the contents of a text file and count the number of letters occurring in the file with the results printed to the terminal.
- Built-in list methods applied on Python list.

### 2D-Array Programs
- Program to define a 2D array and store studentâ€™s marks of different subjects. Calculate the average marks of students and average marks of Subjects.
- A function which accepts a 2D array of integers and its size as arguments and displays the elements of middle row and the elements of middle column and their sum.

### Abstract Data Types (ADT) Programs
- A click counter is a small hand-held device, that contains a push button & a count display. To increment the counter, the button is pushed & new count shows in display. Clicker counters also contain a button that can be pressed to reset the counter to zero. Design & implement the Counter ADT that functions as a hand-held clicker.
- A polygon is a closed geometric shape consisting of three or more line segments that are connected end to end. The endpoints of line segments are known as vertices, which can be defined by points in two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

## Features

- 1D Arrays: These programs contains concept, programs of 1 dimensional arrays to understand concept of programming.
- 2D Arrays: These programs contains concept, programs of 2 dimensional arrays to understand concept of programming.
- Abstract Datatypes: Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations.
- User friendly: Programs of ADT specifically, are user friendly in which all the functionalities are hidden which gives clean user UI.
